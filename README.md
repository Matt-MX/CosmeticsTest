Here is a POC of the capabilities of using display entities to create cosmetics without using a texture pack.

We can use display entities with transformations to move them around the player, updating their rotation to "stick" to the player.

Current implementations are lacking some features such as correct tracking of head rotation (see tophat) and the backpack's body rotation is
primative but WIP.

## Contributions

I'd love to see anyone take interest in this idea since I've not come across any existing cosmetic plugins that use display entities besides ones that rely on texture packs.
